    <h1>Pumpkin Trivia</h1>
    <h2>It's pumpkin o'clock! Learn some fast facts about pumpkins and test your knowledge of pumpkin spiced products</h2>
    <p>Interactive quiz coming soon</p>
    <a>Fun facts (this will be presented in a different format, but for now here is a list of the facts that I will be utilizing)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>The word “pumpkin” originates from “peopon,” which means “large melon” in Greek. It then evolved to “pompon” in French and “pumpion” in Britain. The Americans later changed it to “pumpkin,” the name we use today.</li>
      <li>Technically a fruit, the pumpkin is a winter squash in the family Cucurbitaceae which includes cucumbers and melons.</li>
      <li>Pumpkins are 92 percent water, which is less of a suprising fact when you consider that pumpkins come from the same family as the watermelon and cucumber.</li>
      <li>Every single part of a pumpkin is edible: the skin, leaves, flowers, pulp, seeds, and stems. Pumpkin seeds contain more protein than peanuts and is commonly paired with spices or salt.</li>
      <li>Naturally low in energy density, pumpkins are an excellent source of potassium, vitamin A and beta-carotene, the powerful antioxidant that gives orange vegetables and fruits their color.</li>
    </ul>
