    <h1>Pumpkins: An American Obsession</h1>

    <p>As we learned on the <a href="history.html">history</a> page, pumpkins were an important food source for Native Americans and New England settlers, and as with everything, learning about the context and history of how pumpkins were first cultivated and used makes the American obsession over pumpkins start to seem a little less absurd.</p>

    <p>Americans are particularly keen on the pumpkin scene when fall rolls around, and there's several reasons as to why this is. In psychology, there is an effect called the reactance theory. This theory refers to the strong inclination to act on limited time offers, like seasonal pumpkin spice items. Brands and marketers have recognized and implemented the reactance theory for years, jumping on the autumnal bandwagon to bring consumers new (sometimes outrageous) pumpkin flavored items to the market across different categories from food to hygiene products.</p>

    <p>In fact, according to Nielsen, the annual sales of pumpkin flavored products (products where the flavor noted on the packaging contained the word "pumpkin") reached $488.8 million in the 52 weeks ended August 2018, a 15.5% growth from the previous year and an all-time high for the past five years. To accomodate for all the demand, the amount of acres of pumpkin harvested increased 40% from 2010 to 2019, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. However, as shown on the graph below, the amount of pumpkins harvested in recent years have decreased due to diseases and excessive rain in the midwest which damaged crop yield and production.</p>

    <p>In addition to the reactance theory is social conformity, which is when people match attitudes and behaviors to small groups or society. Social media is inundated with postings and advertisements of the season's first pumpkin spice latte, which makes people want to be in on the fun and feel included with the rest of society.</p>

    <p>There are also many meanings and feelings Americans associate with the season of fall, like the crisp air, fuzzy sweaters, crunchy leaves, apple picking, quality time spent with family on holidays, and most notably, the pumpkin spice flavor. All of these memories and feelings are injected into the fall season which then the pumpkin spice flavor encapsulates to bring about warm, nostalgic feelings. The surge in pumpkin related products limited to the fall season makes pumpkin spice flavors a much more social and nostalgic experience for all.</p>
